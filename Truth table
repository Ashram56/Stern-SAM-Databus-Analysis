Each output of the decoder is connected to an octal D-type flip flop clock input, active from low to high

AUX_LMP is used to drive two additionnal DRV signals for inserts, DRV_8 and DRV_9 allowing for 10x8 insert matrix
DRV_0 is generated from one of the insert matrix flip flop as an input to a watchdog timer (which also monitors voltage)

CLK_INPUT_AUX is a direct connection on the schematics from the decoder to a Octal D flip-flop, with no net name. It allows to drive 5 strobe output, plus RLY_DRV signal which is used for GI

A_STB is connected to pin 10 on J2, pin 1 to 9 (excluding pin 4 which is a connector key) are connected through AUX_DRV
B to E Strobes are connected to pin 9 to 12 on J3, ie AUX_INPUT connector in the datasheet, but those 4 pins are actually output  (used on Tron LE for fiber optics ramp control)

STATUS is a specific signal: it reverses the bus direction.

The STATUS signal is connected to a transceiver, which takes as input various status signals on the board: LMP1STAT, LMP2STAT, 0_CROSS, INTRLK20, INTRLK50.

LMP1STAT and LMP2STAT = status of high current driver used for lamp control, will reflect overheating or no load
0_CROSS = reflect AC voltage zero cross
INTRLK20 and INTRLK50 = reflects 20VAC and 50VAC presence
