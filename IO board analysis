Analysis of Stern SAM schematics

Source: Shrek complete manual, IO driver board schematics

List of connectors:

J10 : 50VDC output and 24VAC output (motor)
J11 : AC voltage input (24V AC and 48V AC)

J15 : General Illumination
J13 : Lamp column
J12 : Lamp rows ground

J9 = High current solenoids
J8 = High current solenoids
J7 = Low current solenoids
J6 = Flash Lamps

J2 = Aux output

J3 = Aux input
Note : pins 9 to 12 are actually on J3 are actually OUTPUT
Pins 1 to 8 are INPUT, driven to the main databus through a reversed transceiver. Probably used to read data for specific use cases


Connector J1 (CPU board input)

Pin 1 to 8:

10k pull-down A1 to A8 input on transceiver 74HC245 (Ax listed below are transceiver input, pins 2 to 9)

1 =  BD3 = A4 transceiver input = D3
2 =  BD4 = A5 transceiver input = D4
3 =  BD2 = A3 transceiver input = D2
4 =  BD5 = A6 transceiver input = D5
5 =  BD1 = A2 transceiver input = D1
6 =  BD6 = A7 transceiver input = D6
7 =  BD0 = A1 transceiver input = D0
8 =  BD7 = A8 transceiver input = D7

Pin 12 to 20

12 = A0 signal
14 = A1 signal
16 = A2 signal
18 = A3 signal
15 = IOSTB

All signals are pulled-up to 5V with 4.7k resistor, except NBReset

13 = NBRESET
20 = Ground

A0 to A3 signals + IO STB are connected to two 74LS138 decoder

First decoder chip

Input

A0 to A2 connected to 3 bits input on 74LS138
A3 = /E2 
IOSTB = /E1
E3 = 5V

Output
/Y0 = SOL A
/Y1 = SOL B
/Y2 = SOL C
/Y3 = FLSH LMP
/Y5 = STATUS
/Y6 = AUX_DRV
/Y7 = AUX_IN

Second decoder chip
A0 to A2 connected to 3 bits input on 74LS138
A3 = E3 
/E2 = GND

/Y0 = LMP_STB
/Y1 = AUX_LAMP
/Y2 = LMP_DRV
/Y3 = CLK input to 74HCT276 flip flop, used to drive 4 strobes on J3 connector (see above)


Decoding analytics:

Based on 74LS138 datasheet

IOSTB controls output of both decoder chip
A3 control which decoder chip is used
A3 = Low : First decoder chip
A3 = High: Second decoder chip

A0 to A2 are decoded from 3 bits to 8 bits, with the following table

A2 A1 A0 = SOL A / SOL B / SOL C / FLSH_LMP / NA / STATUS / AUX_DRV / AUX_IN

000 = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
001 = 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
010 = 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
011 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
100 = 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
101 = 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
110 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
111 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

if A3 is high, all outputs are set to 1, so decoding is done by second decoder chip

A2 A1 A0 = LMP_STB / AUX_LMP / LMP_DRV / CLK_INPUT aux

000 = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
001 = 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
010 = 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
011 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

additionnal output are not used


Connector assignment:

J6 = FLSH_LMP
J7 = SOL_C
J8 = SOL_B
J9 = SOL_A
J12 = LMP_STB
J13 = LMP_DRV
J15 = RLY_DRV = General illumination

Each output of the decoder is connected to an octal D-type flip flop clock input, active from low to high

Analysis:

CPU board is responsible for activating coils / flashers AND turn them off.
Adress bus is used to select "bank", Data bus matches what needs to be driven on the selected bank
Important = CPU boards NEEDS to turn off coils / flashers, since flip flop will keep state output unless there is a low to high transition

Lamp matrix operates through J12 and J13 (LMP_STB and LMP_DRV)
